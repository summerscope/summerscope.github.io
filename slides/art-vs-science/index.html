				<section>
					Let's go back to the beginning...
					<aside class="notes">To understand what we mean by reproducible we get to the heart of what's been causing a bunch of ruffled feathers in academia these past few years...</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					What is the reproducibility crisis?
					<aside class="notes">This refers to a movement challenging the status quo in science and specifically asks whether current incentives to publish results are resulting in poor research design and supurious research results.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					You'll never believe what happened when scientists attempted to replicate 100 experiments...
					<p class="fragment"><em>Just wait til you see their results</em></p>
					<aside class="notes">Psychologists tried to recreate the experiments conducted by 100 studies, all published recently in academic journals.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<blockquote>
						"<b>97%</b> of the original results showed a statistically significant effect, this was reproduced in only <b>36%</b> of the replication attempts"

					What's to blame? Clickbait! 
					<aside class="notes">Seriously though, the incentives for publishing focus on new, unique findings. If those findings can turn into misleading clickbait so much the better!</aside>

					How do we define 'reproducibility'?
