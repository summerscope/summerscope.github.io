					<aside class="notes">In 2012 Amy Cuddy, a social psychologist, gave a TED talk which propelled her to a certain kind of fame. Talk got over 51 million views on TED. (prof at Harvard Business School)</aside>			
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="img/power-pose.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">She claimed that standing in a particular pose for 2 minutes a day could make you more successful. This became known as the power pose.</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Field study</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Her claims were based on a field study she conducted which measured self-reported feelings of power, observed risk taking + cortisol and testosterone levels from a sample of 42. Participants stood in two poses for a minute each - half in power poses, the others in non-power (weak) poses.</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="img/high-power.png">
					<p>High power poses</p>
					<aside class="notes">Her study claimed that holding the power pose was like super power, giving you a physical and psychological edge in all kids of high stress circumstances, like negotiations and job titles. </aside>

					Reproducibility crisis
					<aside class="notes">Meanwhile in Nov 2011 a movement kicked off challenging the status quo in science. A number of scientists were worried about the quality of results getting published, and asking whether enough work is being done to independently validate results.</aside>

				<section>
					<h2>Reproducibility project</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Brian Nosek of Open Science Foundation U of Virginia wanted to try to reproduce published studies to see if they could replicate the effects. This issue has been raised before. Feynman 1970s - Cargo Cult lecture. </aside>

					<aside class="notes">Another way of expressing this would be to say that p values just below 0.05 are overrepresented. The published results “hug” the p = 0.05 significance line. So each of the studies tended to report an effect just strong enough to be statistically significant. It’s very difficult to see how such a pattern could arise – except through bias.</aside>
