					<aside class="notes">Another way of expressing this would be to say that p values just below 0.05 are overrepresented. The published results “hug” the p = 0.05 significance line. So each of the studies tended to report an effect just strong enough to be statistically significant. It’s very difficult to see how such a pattern could arise – except through bias.</aside>
