              what we could do differently to change the outcome. If the answer
              is "be born a different gender", or "have a wealthy family" -
              these aren't helpful. Think of an admin view, or admin dashboard.
              What can you expose to them to help them assess the correctness of
              the decision?

              Unfortunately one of the realities of machine learning is the cast

              User feedback can turn into labeled data for re-training. Let
              folks change their mind, and preferences. If you're not doing
              continuous learning, plan for frequent re-training. Establish a
              baseline of feedback - perhaps sentiment analysis to identify
              positive or negative, if not other metric. Set thresholds of
              quality - if breaching these, set up alerts in slack, pager duty
              etc - let your engineers know that something has gone wrong.
