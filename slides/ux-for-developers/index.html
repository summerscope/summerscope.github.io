				<blockquote>
					UX (user experience) as a discipline is messy, imperfect, filled with overlapping methodologies. It's an umbrella term that's
					so broad it can feel meaningless. It sometimes lacks internal consistency. It's a work in progress. It's immature and
					it needs to get better.

				<blockquote>
					Your ability to practice introspection and empathy and then use your learning in each to develop the other, in other words,

				<aside class="notes">In other words - this is about building better product, but also a better you. Better communication,
