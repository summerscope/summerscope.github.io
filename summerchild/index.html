    <h1>Sweet Summer Child Score</h1>
    <p><em>Risk assessment quiz for automation and ML</em></p>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      What is it? Sweet Summer Child Score (SSCS) is a scoring mechanism
      for latent risk. It will help you quickly and efficiently scan
      for the possibility of harm to people and communities by a
      socio-technical system. Note that harms to animals and the
      environment are not considered.
    </p>

    <p>
      SSCS takes a step back away
      from the specifics of your technology and looks at environmental,
      systems and human factors. It's intended to be used at the ideation
      part of your process, to critique product ideas or compare competing
      features. But SSCS can also be used post-hoc to critique an existing
      system, or propose approaches to harm mitigation.

    <h3>How long does it take?</h3>
    <p>
      If you're familiar with the automated decision system it should take
      8-10 minutes to complete. Respond with your gut, don't overthink
      it too much. Critiquing proposals/ideas You can absolutely use
      the score to critique ideas that aren't developed yet. You need to
      have sufficiently sketched it out and have the rough shape &amp;
      feature set of the proposal or idea.
    </p>

    <h3>How is it calculated?</h3>
    <p>
      You start with a score of 99 (the highest score possible, to
      acknowledge the impossibility of building and deploying something
      perfectly fair, or perfectly accurate and bug-free). As you answer
      questions, points are deducted from your score. The sections
      are worth roughly 1/3 each. The multiplier score will reduce the
      overall cost of points deductions in-line with the scope of your
      system overall.
    </p>

    <h3>Who can use it?</h3>
    <p>
      This is designed for use by data scientists, product managers, and
      other technologists. However it's simple enough that end-users,
      journalists and auditors can use it as a form of socio-technical
      critique. This score is model and stack agnostic, so you don't
      need to see 'under-the-hood' to use it. How should you use it?
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a qualitative assessment and relies on you to complete it
      honestly. There's no point if you're just going to give yourself
      the best score! Without discussing first, have multiple people
      in your team complete the quiz. How close were your scores? Which
      areas did you agree and disagree? Discuss and attempt to resolve
      the differences, especially where there are answers that are 2 or
      more steps away from each other. Why don't we scan for minority
      identities? We focus on the disadvantages usually experienced by
      these populations rather than the demographics of disadvantage. We
      don't want to contribute to the conflation of minority identities
      and harm.
